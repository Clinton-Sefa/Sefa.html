Dynamic Photo Gallery with Multi-Album Feature
​Project Overview
​This is a dynamic, responsive photo gallery built using fundamental web technologies (HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript). The key feature is the ability to manage and display multiple distinct albums from a single data source.
​This project was created as an exercise to solidify my understanding of DOM manipulation and JavaScript data structures.
​ Key Features Implemented
​Multi-Album View: Displays album cards with titles and photo counts on the homepage.
​Dynamic Loading: Clicking an album card dynamically generates the grid of thumbnail images specific to that album.
​Data-Driven: All album content (image paths, captions, and grouping) is managed from a single, easy-to-update JavaScript object (galleryAlbums).
​Modal/Lightbox View: Clicking a thumbnail opens a full-screen modal with navigation arrows for a slideshow effect.
​Responsive Design: The layout adjusts automatically for different screen sizes (desktop and mobile).
